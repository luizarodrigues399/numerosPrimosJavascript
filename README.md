<p>Teste de Javascript da empresa Green Bay Solutions, presente  <a target='_blank' href=https://westpoint.airtec.ai/render/junior-frontend-developer-f-q5-i5>aqui</a> e minha resolução <a target='_blank' href='https://luizarodrigues399.github.io/numerosPrimosJavascript/'>aqui</a>.</p> 

<p><b>Code challenge </b></p>

<p><b>Goals:</b></p> 
<ul>
  <li>Finds all the prime numbers between 1 and 1000.</li>
  <li>Sums all the prime numbers that you found between 1 and 1000.</li>
  <li>The `main` function should return the sum of all prime numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Develop the solution entirely on this editor.</p>

<p>A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 etc are prime numbers. 
4 for example, is not a prime number since 4 is divisible by 2. 4 / 2 = 2.</p> 

<p>Bonus points for a more functional approach in your code. 
For example, try to use array functions such as map, filter or reduce.</p>
